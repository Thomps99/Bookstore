Online Bookstore Management System

This script provides a command-line based management system for an online bookstore.

Features:
- Bookstore Inventory Management: Add, remove, and update books.
- User Authentication and Authorization: Implement user authentication for staff members with role-based access control.
- Customer Features: Search for books, view book details, and make purchases.

Usage:
Run the `bookstore.py` script and follow the prompts to log in as a user and manage the bookstore inventory or make purchases.

Challenges:
- Handling different roles and permissions for users.
- Ensuring secure storage and retrieval of user credentials.

Special Considerations:
- The script uses a simple simulated database for storing books and users.
- User credentials are stored in plain text for simplicity. For a production system, use secure password storage.

Version Control:
- The project is managed using Git for version control.
- Different versions are managed using branches and merges.
